        Hi, I\'m Daemon.
        \n\nUnrelated placeholder text about the definition of a daemon from wikipedia.
        \n\nDaimon or Daemon (δαίμων: "god", "godlike", "power", "fate") originally referred to a lesser deity
        \nor guiding spirit such as the daimons of ancient Greek religion
        \nand mythology and of later Hellenistic religion and philosophy.
        \n\nThe word is derived from Proto-Indo-European *daimon
        \n"provider, divider (of fortunes or destinies)," from the root *da- "to divide".
        \nDaimons were possibly seen as the souls of men of the golden age acting as tutelary deities,
        \naccording to entry δαίμων at Liddell \&amp; Scott.
        \n\nAlso daimonic: a religious, philosophical, literary and psychological concept.
